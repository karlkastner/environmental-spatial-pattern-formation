Source code accompanying the manuscript:

Spatial pattern formation in heterogeneous environments, Karl KÃ¤stner et al.


Requirement:
- GNU/Linux (recommended operating system)
- Matlab R2023b (older versions probably work, toolbox dependencies listed in
                 in pattern_periodicity_test_metadata.m)
- dependencies from https://github.com/karlkastner

The script "pattern_formation_batch" reproduces the whole workflow.
It first fetches dependencies from GitHub, and subsequently executes scripts 
for fetching and analyzing the patterns, followed by plotting the results.

The GPL v. 3 extends over all files in the repository, i.e. computer scripts,
documentation and geospatial data files, except for the sample satellite images
in the input folder, which are property of Google / Maxar Technologies (2023).
